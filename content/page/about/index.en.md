### Programming languages-related

* Learning

I am not good at interpreted or dynamically typed languages, as I mainly work with C-based languages.
I have touched a wide range of languages not listed here.

I am not good at Python for religious reasons. Indentation and global declarations are especially unacceptable.

I don't do infrastructure or cloud computing, so I have no idea. I'm a small fry engineer who can't keep up with the latest trends.

<u>Don't run away from Python.</u>

* Speculation and Investment
  
  I do FX, virtual currency, and the trendy X to Earn.<br/>
  I'm quite interested in the technology around blockchain and would like to study it.
